                    <p style = "margin-bottom: 35px;"> Our Website is a brand new one, but despite that the quality of the people who teach is nothing but impressive. If you were to take our courses, then you'd find courses in a lot of different programming languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript but also different frameworks such as React, Angular etc., most of which at the moment are about Front-End Programming. However, despite that most of our courses available are about Front-End programming languages/frameworks, it doesn't mean that that won't change soon since we are looking on creating courses about Back-End languages/frameworks.</p>
